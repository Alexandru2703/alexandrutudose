        <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Hello there! I'm Alex Tudose, a passionate about IT, Hardware, Software and entry Full Stack Development and this is my page. <span style="color: #001e46;" class="bold-text">Enjoy!

        <h2>About Me<img src="icons/info.svg" alt="info" width="30" height="30"></h2>
        <p>My passion about IT began from an early age, when I was about 9 years old, beginning with cleaning of ballpoint mouses and keyboards to this point where I'm writing in my HTML extension.
            I'm that kind of person that is trying to learn something new everyday. My skills are entirely self-taught, honed to years of hands-on experience, relentless online reasearch and perseverance.
            With a profund passion for IT, I've spent the past years immersed in the ever-evolving landscape of information technology. My professional journey has taken me through a diverse array of projects and challenges, from helping friends and relatives with problems of their phones and computers to administer databases, software and hardware improvements of diverse firms, from hotels to retail stores and
            seeing an increase of revenue compared to last years.I'm driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence and a commitment to solving complex problems with innovative solutions. Whether it's optimizing systems, securing data, or developing software that streamlines processes, I approach every task with unwavering determination and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge.</p>

        <h2>My Works<img src="icons/ribbon.svg" alt="info" width="30" height="30"></h2>
        <h2> Here is a list of some of my projects. </h2>
        <div class="project">
            <img src="project1.png" alt="Project 1">
            <h2>Project 1</h2>
            <h3>Project Description: Drone Flight Control</h3>
            <p> In this project, I developed custom code to control the flight of a drone. By writing and implementing algorithms, I enabled the drone to perform precise maneuvers, including takeoff, landing, and navigating through waypoints. The code integrated real-time data from various sensors to ensure stable and safe flight. In this project I've used the application "Mission Planner".</p>

        <div class="project">
            <img src="project2.png" alt="Project 2">
            <h2>Project 2</h2>
            <h3>Project Description: Topography Mapping</h3>
            <p>In this project, I harnessed the power of open-source tools and data to create detailed topography maps. By leveraging accessible resources and collaborating with the open-source community, I developed accurate and informative maps that showcased the terrain of various areas. This project not only emphasized my commitment to open-source principles but also demonstrated the ability to provide valuable geographic information for diverse applications, from environmental planning to recreational exploration. In this project I've used "QGis 3.16", "InkScape" "GRASS 7.8.4" and open source databases. </p>

        <div class="project">
            <img src="project3.png" alt="Project 3">
            <h2>Project 3</h2>
            <h3>Project Description: Laser-Cut Wood Creations with Machine Programming</h3>
            <p> This project was an exploration of crafting objects from wood using a 5W laser, but it went a step further by involving machine programming. Through careful design and coding, I harnessed the precision of laser technology to create intricate, custom-made wood objects. This project highlighted the synergy between artistic design and programming, resulting in a collection of finely detailed creations. It exemplifies how the fusion of creative design and meticulous machine programming can yield both functional and decorative pieces from natural materials, demonstrating the potential of technology to elevate craftsmanship.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <img src="project4.png" alt="Project 4">
            <h2> Project 4</h2>
            <h3>Project Description: Store Logo Design</h3>
            <p> This project involved the creation of a distinctive, registered logo for a store. Through a creative process that included market research, conceptualization, and graphic design, I developed a unique visual identity that encapsulates the brand's essence. The registered logo serves as a memorable and legally protected symbol that represents the store's values and products, enhancing its brand recognition and consumer trust.</p>
